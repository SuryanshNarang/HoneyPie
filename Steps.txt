in ssh_honeypot.py file: 
import logging library ( we dont have to install it as it is now a part of python)

STEP2: We need to name our logger we're going to use getLogger method as part of the logging library
there are different level of logs that logging module will provide for us like: logging.debug, info, warning
STEP3: setting handler basically set where we are going to log to which is from a library: which is import logging:
from logging.handlers import RotatingFileHandler


STEP4: next is adding format add to the constants (how do we want our messages to be formatted)


We have to repeat the same thing as one audits.log will be for usernames,ip and password
and another one will be for what hackers are doing( mainly analysing their activities)


Till now we have the emulated Shell and setted up the server using paramiko (which provides the functions)


SSH key gen is a tool to make the publcprivate key pair.
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -f server.key

#server.key needs to be guarded as we can see after this command 2files are made: server.key.pub can be public but not server.key it should be kept private and not uploaded on github.


By passing the Server instance to Transport (using start_server(server=server)), you’re linking the two so that the Transport can use the Server’s methods to manage SSH requests appropriately.



Python comes with extensive web server support so it is basically easier to setup a webBased Honeypot rather than ssh
